# Unemployment Rate in California between 2008-2024

<h2>Goal</h2>
To determine unemployment trends in California between Jan 1, 2008- March 1, 2024. Furthermore, this was an exercise to explore a new visualization tool Seaborn Visualization.

<h2>Dataset Used</h2>

The dataset used includes Area Type (State level), Area Name (California only), Date, Year, Month, and age groups.

<h2>Analysis</h2>

The following graphs were created using Seaborn visualization library.

The first graph, below, shows the unemployment rate in California between 2008-2024. There are two bands that are of note:

- Red Band denotes a spike in unemployment rate due to the Recession
- Blue Band denotes a spike in unemployment rate due to COVID19

Although not definitive, it seems the unemployment rate in 2024 has started to rise again; it waits to be seen if the trend will continue to grow.

The second graph, below, shows the unemployment rate split by age group. We can clearly see the unemployment rate for people between 16-19 is the highest with rates over 20%. However, this is not surprising as that is the age range in which the people are still in school. Unemployment rate trends downwards as the age group gets older.

The third graph, below, shows the unemployment rate by age group over time. It is clear that the youngest age groups were hit the hardest with the age group of 16-19 spiking to more than 35% unemployment rate between 2010 and 2014. Similar case happened during COVID too.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

From the data provided, younger age groups tend to have higher unemployment rate until the 35-44 age group. This is mainly because most people within or past this age group has completed any higher education they wanted. It could also be due to the fact that people have found stable jobs.
